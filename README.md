# Elephant selfbot

Just a simple selfbot that is still being updated.

## How to setup

To setup the selfbot all you need to do is go to settings.json 
and put your token between the parenthesis in the thing called token
and then put your id in the id place. And then click run.bat to run the bot.

Or you could not put the token and just type it into the command line when you run, run.bat but you need the id in the id thingy

(the userid you choose will be the user running the commands.)
